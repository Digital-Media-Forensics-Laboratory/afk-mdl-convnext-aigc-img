This model is designed for AIGC (AI-Generated Content) image discrimination. It supports the detection of images generated by popular AIGC models such as Stable Diffusion, as well as those produced by application software (e.g., Doubao AI). Additionally, the model is capable of detecting JPEG-compressed images.

The model is currently in the validation stage, and weights will be iteratively updated in the future.
